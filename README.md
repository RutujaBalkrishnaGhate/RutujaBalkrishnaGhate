## About Me

Hello! I am Rutuja Ghate, a passionate software developer with a solid academic foundation and practical experience in the field. I hold a Master's degree in Information Systems from Northeastern University, where I specialized in areas such as application engineering, database management, web design, and software quality control. My Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from Savitribai Phule Pune University provided me with a strong grounding in object-oriented programming, data structures, and system programming.

During my time at Northeastern University, I served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, designing and managing course content for over 200 students in Web Design and User Experience Engineering. This role honed my ability to convey complex technical concepts effectively and provide personalized guidance to students.

My professional experience as a Software Developer at Accenture involved developing and deploying features that significantly improved transaction accuracy and user satisfaction. I have a proven track record of resolving high-priority issues, ensuring secure user access, and maintaining high code coverage through meticulous testing.
